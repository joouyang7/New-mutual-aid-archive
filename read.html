<h2>Solidarity Economy and Mutual Aid</h2>
<p2>Solidarity Economy is the economic theory that “solidarity should be introduced into the economy itself, it should become active in the various phases of the economic cycle, in production, circulation, consumption and accumulation. This implies producing with solidarity, distributing with solidarity, consuming with solidarity, accumulating and developing with solidarity” (Solidarity Economy Roads, Luis Razeto Migliaro, Translated by Matt Noyes).
    <br><br>
    <p2> The two dimensions of a solidarity economy include: a process of progressive and expanding “solidarization” in the global economy, and a process of gradual development and construction of a specific solidarity economy sector.
<br><br>
<p2>Mutual aid is a practice within the solidarity economy collectively coordinate and "meet each other's needs, usually from an awareness that the systems we have in place are not going to meet them"(Dean Spade, Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During This Crisis (And The Next), 2020).</p2>
<br><br>
<p2>Spade outlines the key three elements of mutual aid: <br> 
1. Mutual aid projects work to meet survival needs and build and build shared understanding about why people do not have what they need. 
<br>2. Mutual aid projects mobilize people, expand solidarity, and build movements.
<br>3. Mutual aid projects are participatory, solving problems through collective action rather than waiting for saviors.</p2>
<br><br>
<p2>There is also a clear distinction between charity and mutual aid. “Contemporary charity comes with eligibility requirements such as sobriety, piety, curfews, participation in job training or parenting courses, cooperation with the police, a lawful immigration status, or identifying the paternity of children. In charity programs, social workers, health care providers, teachers, clergy, lawyers, and government workers determine which poor people deserve help.”
    <br><br>
“Charity is increasingly privatized and contracted out to the massive nonprofit sector, which benefits rich people more than poor people in two big ways. First, elite donors get to run the show. They decide what gets funded and what doesn’t… Second, the nonprofit system creates a tax shelter for rich people.”
<br><br>
“Mutual aid projects, in many ways, are defined in opposition to the charity model and rs current iteration in the nonprofit sector. Mutual aid projects mobilize lots of people rather than a few experts; resist the use of eligibility criteria that cut out more stigmatized people; are an integrated part of our lives rather than a pet cause; and cultivate a shared analysis of the root causes of the problem and connect people to social movements that can address these causes.”
</p2>

<h2>Archive Methodology</h2>
<p2>This project archives mutual aid relationships, entry points into movement organizing, preparation and reaction to crises, systemic failures, and the limits of mutual aid. The "Mutual Aid" Archive reflects responses from the public participation/submission form. Participants' contact information is not shared.</p2>
