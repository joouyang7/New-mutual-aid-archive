      <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <p2> Mutual aid is collective coordination to meet each other's needs, usually from an awareness that the systems we have in place are not going to meet them (Dean Spade, Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During This Crisis (And The Next), 2020).
</p2>
<p2>This project archives relationships, organizations, movements, campaigns, crisis preparations/reactions, systemic failures, and the limits of "mutual aid." </p2>
